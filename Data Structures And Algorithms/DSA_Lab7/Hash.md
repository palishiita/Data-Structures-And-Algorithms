- Hashing
- Hashtable (Hashmap)
  HashMap is non-synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized, which means Hashtable is thread-safe and can be shared
  between multiple threads but HashMap can not be shared between multiple threads without proper synchronization.
- Hash function: translates the key associated with each data into a hash code
- Hashcode: A hash code is an integer value that is associated with each object in Java.
